There are many types of operators in Java which are given below : 
- Unary Operator  (expr++ / expr-- | ++expr / --expr | ~(bitwise complement) !)
- Arithmetic Operator (* / % + -)
- Shift (The Java left shift operator << is used to shift all of the bits in a value to the left side of a specified number of times.)
- Relational (Comparison & equality)
- Bitwise (& ^ |)
- Logical (AND, OR)
- Ternary ( ? : )
- Assignment (short + short = int : Compile Time Error -> Solution : TypeCasting)
